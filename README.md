# Pixel Perfect Cloud

This application is is currently being developed in PRJ666 in the Winter semester of 2022 by Team 8.

The goal of this project is to create a web app/web extension that will allow users to drag and drop images from the web and save them on right the cloud.
This gives users access to all their images in one place and allow them to acesss them through desktop and mobile devices.
Images can take up a lot of space and storing them on your own device can prove a hassle as storing a lot of images can get disoragnized quickly and will eat up quite a bit of storage space.
This application is here to solve that problem.

Unlike other cloud services which focus on storing files, our application will heavily focus on digital media.
The main features of this application is allow users to sort throught their images, tag their images to organize them and also edit them right on the application itself.
This application will be helpful for artist, digital designers, video editors or just the average user looking to have a good solution for storing images without sacrificing space on their own devices.

As mentioned before this application is being developed to be a web app and an extension.
Our goal is to hopefully deploy the application on Vercel as a web app and make it available on the Google Chrome store as a web application.
